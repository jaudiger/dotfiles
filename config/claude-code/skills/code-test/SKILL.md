# Code Test Audit

## Interactive mode (no arguments or partial arguments)

If the user did not provide all three pieces of information (language, practice, targets), print a single prompt that lists every missing piece and ask the user to reply with their choices. Do NOT use the AskUserQuestion tool -- it truncates options. Instead, output the choices as formatted text directly in the conversation.

For each missing piece, print a numbered section:

1. **Language** (if `$0` is missing or invalid) -- list all languages from the table below with their available practices.
2. **Practice** (if `$1` is missing or invalid) -- list every valid practice for the chosen/given language.
3. **Targets** (if no targets were provided) -- explain the target syntax (see below) and use Glob to discover candidate source files matching the chosen language in the current workspace. List them as suggested `file:` targets. If there are too many candidates, ask for a glob pattern instead.

Present everything in one message so the user can answer all at once (e.g., "go, edge-cases, file:pkg/auth/login.go file:pkg/auth/session.go"). Wait for their reply, then proceed to the audit steps below.

## Target syntax

All targets use a prefix to indicate the type of input:

| Prefix | Format | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `file:` | `file:PATH` or `file:PATH#L1-L2` | Single file, optional line range |
| `folder:` | `folder:PATH` | All source files for the language within the dir (recursive) |
| `symbol:` | `symbol:PATH:LINE` or `symbol:PATH:LINE#L1-L2` | Function/struct/class/method at LINE, optional focus range |
| `diff:` | `diff:local`, `diff:branch[:REF]`, `diff:pr:NUMBER_OR_URL`, `diff:commit:SHA` | Changes from a diff source |

Bare paths (no prefix) are treated as `file:PATH` for backward compatibility.

### Resolution rules

**`file:PATH[#L1-L2]`** -- Read the file. If `#L1-L2` is present, analyze only that line range but read enough surrounding context (imports, type definitions) to understand it.

**`folder:PATH`** -- Glob for files matching the language's typical extensions within PATH. Treat each discovered file as a `file:` target.

**`symbol:PATH:LINE[#L1-L2]`** -- Read the file at PATH. Identify the innermost function, method, struct, class, enum, or trait definition containing LINE. Analyze that symbol boundary (from signature to closing delimiter). If `#L1-L2` is appended, focus on that range within the symbol. When invoked standalone (not by deep-review), do NOT chase callers/implementations outside the file. After resolving the symbol, also locate the corresponding test file using project test conventions. The symbol gives the source region; test-file discovery gives the test region to evaluate against it.

**`diff:SOURCE`** -- Resolve the diff:

| Source | Resolution |
|--------|------------|
| `diff:local` | `git diff HEAD` for tracked changes + `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard` for untracked |
| `diff:branch` | Detect default branch (`git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null \| sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@'`, falling back to `main`), then `git diff <default>...HEAD` |
| `diff:branch:REF` | `git diff REF...HEAD` |
| `diff:pr:N` or `diff:pr:URL` | GitHub: `gh pr diff N`, GitLab: `glab mr diff N`. Parse owner/repo/number from URL if needed |
| `diff:commit:SHA` | `git show SHA --stat` for overview, then `git show SHA` for full diff. Read the commit message for intent context |

After resolving the diff, extract changed files and changed line regions (hunks). Apply analysis to the changed code regions (reading full context around hunks). After resolving changed source files, locate corresponding test files. If changed source code lacks test coverage, report it as a finding even if no test file was found.

### Edge cases

- `symbol:` LINE on blank/comment/import -> scan up/down ~20 lines for nearest symbol; error if none found.
- Nested symbols (closures, inner functions) -> resolve to innermost enclosing.
- `#L1-L2` where L2 > file length -> clamp to file length; L1 > file length -> error.
- `folder:` with no matching files -> report "No `<lang>` files found."
- Mixed languages in folder -> the language argument filters which files to include.
- Empty diff -> report "No changes found" and stop.

## Audit steps

**Language:** $0
**Practice:** $1
**Targets:** all arguments after the second are targets to analyze (see Target syntax above).

1. Read [`lang/$0.md`](lang/$0.md) to confirm the practice is valid for this language and load language-specific testing patterns.
2. Read [`practice/$1.md`](practice/$1.md) to load the testing practice methodology and checklist.
3. Resolve all targets into concrete code regions using the target resolution rules.
4. **Detect language version and test framework** -- inspect project files (`go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `build.gradle.kts`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `setup.cfg`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `Makefile`, `build.zig.zon`, etc.) to identify:
   - The language version in use.
   - The test framework and its version.
   - Any test utility libraries (assertion libraries, mocking frameworks, property-based testing tools).
   Adapt all subsequent recommendations to the actual versions detected. Read the actual test code imports to verify API usage matches the detected version rather than assuming a specific API shape. Do NOT recommend APIs, annotations, helpers, or patterns that do not exist in the detected version.
5. **Locate test files** -- for each target source file (or resolved source region), find the corresponding test file(s) using the project's test conventions (co-located `_test.go`, `mod_test.rs`, `*.test.ts`, `*Test.java`, `test_*.py`, etc.). Read each test file in full. If no test file exists, report it as a critical finding.
6. **Read source files** -- read every target source file in full. Build a model of: all functions/methods, their parameters (types and domains), return types, branching structure, error paths, and side effects.
7. Apply the loaded practice checklist against the source-test pair.

## Rules

- Read EVERY line of each source and test file. Do not skip or skim.
- **Derive test expectations from the interface, not the implementation.** Examine parameter types, return types, and documented contracts. For each input, enumerate the equivalence classes and boundary values of its domain. Flag any equivalence class that has no corresponding test, even if the current code does not distinguish it -- that is precisely where bugs hide.
- For each finding provide:
  - **Source file** and **line number(s)** of the untested or poorly tested code.
  - **Test file** and **line number(s)** of the relevant test (if it exists).
  - **Practice** (`branch-coverage`, `edge-cases`, `assertions`, `isolation`, `negative-testing`, `mutation-resistance`).
  - **Severity**:
    - `critical` -- no tests exist, or tests are provably unable to detect faults in critical logic.
    - `high` -- significant branches or failure modes are untested.
    - `medium` -- edge cases or secondary paths lack coverage.
    - `low` -- minor improvements to test quality or structure.
  - **Description** -- what is missing or wrong and why it matters.
  - **Suggested test** -- a concrete test case description (inputs, expected outcome, what bug it would catch). Describe the test; do not write full implementation code.
- When analyzing a `symbol:` target, report the symbol name and its span in the heading for that target's findings.
- When analyzing a `diff:` target, focus on changed and added code. Flag pre-existing issues in unchanged lines only if a change makes them actively dangerous.
- If you find NO issues for a section, say so explicitly -- do not invent problems.
- Do NOT modify any files. This is analysis only.
- At the end, produce a summary table of all findings grouped by severity.
